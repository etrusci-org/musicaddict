# Music Addict

An idle game for audionauts. Written just for fun on a couch while I was forced to take a break. Excuse my JavaScript skills ;-D



## Requirements

A modern web-browser (as of 2021).



## Where to play

[Play the latest version online](https://etrusci-org.github.io/musicaddict/musicaddict/index.html) or [download the code](https://github.com/etrusci-org/musicaddict) and play it locally on your computer (no internet connection required then).



## How to play

No input is required once the game is running.

Progress data will be stored in the local storage of your web-browser. This happens on a regular interval or when you pause the game.

You can also reset or export your progress data, but there's no way to import data at the moment.
